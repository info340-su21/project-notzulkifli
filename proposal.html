        <p>One of the applications that were similar to our topic was <a href="https://www.fitnessblender.com/">Fitness Blender.</a> One reason why this website does not achieve in solving the problem stated earlier is because the website does not feel very personal. It has great information and video essays on working out, even for beginners, but it puts it in a one size fits all type of schematic, and itâ€™s easy for it to feel not very personal, and overall unmotivating.</p>
        <p>Another application similar to our topic was <a href="https://www.chloeting.com/">Chloe Ting.</a> Chloe Ting's website incorporate both fitness videos and nutritional recipes for the user to stay active and stay healthy while following the programs provided. The one reason why this website does not achieve in solving the problem stated earlier is because of keeping track of the progress made. Some other apps have a role in keeping track of the users progress, but the website does not have a function towards that.</p>
